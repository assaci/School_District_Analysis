# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

The PyCity school board wants to repeat analysis of the district information to support their decision of upholding state-testing standards after finding out that the grades from Thomas High School 9th graders were altered. 
The purpose of this project is to analysis information, student funding and standardized testing scores of all schools in the district and create a report to provide insight to schools’ trends and performance and assist school board and superintendent in making decision regarding schools’ budgets and priorities.
